<h3>A bit about Millile</h3>
<p>We got Millie when she was just a puppy, we taught her how to be cool, calm and collected. She is less yappy than your average pomeranian but she still has her moments. Shes a total floof ball of love and is overly-attached to her mom, but shares the love with me too.</p>
<h4>Heres a few more pictures of her.</h4>
